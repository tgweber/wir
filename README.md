# wir
Let's try something new:

* Academic communication that is not discrete but continuous.
* Academic research that is not driven by individual ambition but by cooperative fun.
* Academic work without the boring manual work that can be automated.
* Academic advances that leave no one behind.

If it sounds like an utopia, it is.
But these goals are worth a shot, aren't they?

## What is this about?

We want to provide a proof of concept
how academic communication, research and work
could be designed and executed in an utopian yet realizable setting - 
with no politics, no career ambition, no bullshit.
This is an attempt, that will be openly and transparently documented from the beginning
(including typos, knowledge gaps, misunderstandings).
You can follow the progress by following the commit history of this repository.

### How do we achieve that?
We will work asynchronously in this public repository.
One of the key ideas is
to continously blog about the current status.
There is an outline that can be derived from the blog directory.
More details will become clear over the next time.

### Why the the name "wir"?
"Wir" is German for we.
This stresses one of the core values of this project:
science and the humanities should not be driven by ambition,
but by the wish to extend and share knowledge.

It can also be considered an abbreviation for:
* "What Is Relevant?"
* "We Improve Research!"

Most important, it's short, hopefully a bit catchy and we need to start with something.

## How can I contribute?
Currently this only talk, no action.
But open and barrier-free contribution possibilities should be one of the core features of wir.
Until we figure out how exactly we can achieve this,
open an issue or make a pull request if you have something to say.

Currently, we are in bootstrapping mode:
the initial committer will play the role of the maintainer similar to open source projects:
pull requests and issues will be decided upon by a single person.
This is far from optimal (considering the initial statement above),
but we need to start somehow with enough structure to have a path to evolve.
This will remain until there is clarity which roles and responsibilities are needed
and who is willing and capable to fulfill them.

If you disagree with this approach, 
you are welcome to fork the repository and continue in a different manner.
